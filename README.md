# [Secure (Facebook) Chat](http://secure-chat.zhuzhu.org)

* Encrypt your messages locally and send to Facebook!
* Old messages will automatically fade away and may be deleted (like SnapChat).
* Only your recipients can decrypt your messages, not even Facebook or NSA!
* (This is still an unfinished project! Please don't reply on it.)
